<h3>General Questions</h3>
<ol>
    <li id="gq_1">
        What is GDW?
        <p>The Genomics Data Warehouse (GDW) provides the UB community a tool for storing, searching and searching their genomic data.</p>
    </li>

    <li id="gq_2">
        What is the purpose of GDW?
        <p>The purpose of GDW is to support UB community's research. By providing them the tools to analyze their genomics data, we hope to accelerate their research.</p>
    </li>

    <li id="gq_3">
        Where does the data for GDW come from?
        <p>The data for GDW comes from the UB community.</p>
    </li>

    <li id="gq_4">
        How can I get access to GDW?
        <p>To get access to GDW please contact us at big-help@buffalo.edu.</p>
    </li>

    <li id="gq_5">
        What is MSEA?
        <p>Mutation Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) attempts to discern significant clusters of mutations within genes. For a given gene, its mutations are assigned to any of 11 sets. These sets, which are not mutually exclusive, are categorized by factors of predicted pathogenicity and predicted effect on the amino acid product. The likelihood of each mutation setâ€™s physical distribution along the length of the gene is then assessed against a simulated random distribution of the same number of mutations. This likelihood is repeated many times, reshuffling the simulated distribution each time (permutation testing). A mutation set which exhibits non-random clustering is likely to be of interest, and will be teased out using this analysis. See the Methods section of the <a target="_blank" href="http://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-014-0489-9">linked paper</a> for more details.</p>
